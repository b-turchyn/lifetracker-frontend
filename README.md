# Lifetracker Frontend

This is a frontend service to serve up data from [Felix Krause's
LifeSheet](https://github.com/KrauseFx/FxLifeSheet). This pairs with [my Golang
backend](https://github.com/b-turchyn/lifetracker-backend).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
